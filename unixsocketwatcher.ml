(** unixsocketwathcer.ml: Routines to handle unix sockets for fd passing *)
(* Semantics for the client C, script S and Vsys, V
 * - V creates a UNIX socket and listens on it, adding a watch
 * - C connects to the socket
 * - V accepts the connection, forks, execve()s S and gets out of the way
 * - S sends an fd to C and closes the connection
 * - If one of S or C dies, then the other gets a SIGPIPE, Vsys gets a sigchld,
 * either way, Vsys should survive the transaction.
